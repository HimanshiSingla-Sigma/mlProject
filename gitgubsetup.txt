step 1 - > make a github repository
    a) virtual environment  -> conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
                            -> now activate the virtual environment -> conda activate venv/
                            -> next step is to sync the github repository with vs code after activating the venv
                            -> to sync the github , just follow the steps given in the github only
                            -> after syncing create a .gitignore file in github only and select python
                            -> git pull -> to make the .gitignore file visible in vs code , this file automatically contains venv 
    b) setup.py -> make after .gitignore 
    c) requirements.txt -> contains all the necessary files and also -e . command to 
    automatically trigger setup.py in order to create a package for our machine learning application
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    d) src folder -> main folder in which we will be building our entire application and this 
    will work as a package which others can import 
step2 -> components folder inside src folder (having __init__.py , so that it can be imported as a package) in which we will have different modules for our application like
data ingestion -> reading data from a particular source is called data ingestion(this will also contain the code for splitting the data into training and testing ) (data_ingestion.py)
after data ingestion , we have data transformation (like one hot encoding , label encoding)(data_transformation.py)
model trainer -> in this file , we will train the models (mode_trainer.py)
step3 -> pipeline folder in src folder -> this will contain three files
    a) __init__.py
    b) train_pipeline.py
    c) predict_pipeline.py
step4 -> src folder will also contain logger.py , exception.py & utils.py( all the general things which i need for my entire application is written here)
utils.py -> can contain mongodb client (connection), or save the model to cloud code
