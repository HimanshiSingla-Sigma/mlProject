step 1 - > make a github repository
    a) virtual environment  -> conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
                            -> now activate the virtual environment -> conda activate venv/
                            -> next step is to sync the github repository with vs code after activating the venv
                            -> to sync the github , just follow the steps given in the github only
                            -> after syncing create a .gitignore file in github only and select python
                            -> git pull -> to make the .gitignore file visible in vs code , this file automatically contains venv 
    b) setup.py -> make after .gitignore 
    c) requirements.txt -> contains all the necessary files and also -e . command to 
    automatically trigger setup.py in order to create a package for our machine learning application
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    d) src folder -> main folder in which we will be building our entire application and this 
    will work as a package which others can import
